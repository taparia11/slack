The magazine highlights members of the community, 'columnist' content and posts, etc.\n• An underrated LinkedIn strategy for personal accounts is \"comments as content.\" Finding members of the community you're trying to reach and having team members leave genuine, thoughtful comments on their posts can drastically increase reach.",
