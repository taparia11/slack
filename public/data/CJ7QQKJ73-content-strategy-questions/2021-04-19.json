Including some ways we repurpose them below:\n• Blog post (highlighting the full infographic)\n• Social media series using snippets of the graphic\n• We also create a PDF version of the infographic that our sales team uses. They've found some good success by leveraging these assets, especially our BDRs\n• We also use them in our paid media display efforts (for retargeting) and boosted posts on LinkedIn\n• Email integration - typically we're just linking to the blog post, but it could be an interesting content piece to break down in a dedicate email (depending on the content itself) \nI haven't used an infographic directory in the past few years, but wouldn't doubt if you can still find some out there.\n\nAre there any other use cases you were thinking of but are missing from my list? (always looking for ways to get more out of our content haha)",
