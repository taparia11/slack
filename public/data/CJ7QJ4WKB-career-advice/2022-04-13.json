                                "text": "'s insights about content marketing not being the #1 hire is an interesting take and one I generally agree with, the only caveat being that content takes time to rank and show results, so you ideally want to be planting those seeds early.\n\nThe role I'm in now is kind of a hybrid of product and content marketing — I'm responsible for positioning, messaging, competitive research, launches, the website, and contributing to initiatives around onboarding, pricing, and customer research. But I'm also starting up the content marketing program (with a small team of freelancers!) because I have experience with that and we need to be focusing on top-of-funnel. I don't touch paid ads (except to have a sense of what we're doing); we're also in the process of hiring a Growth Lead.\n\nFor more great insights on this, I'm going to point to another MKT1 article about the fuel and the engine — such a good metaphor for how content\/product\/growth marketing work together: "
