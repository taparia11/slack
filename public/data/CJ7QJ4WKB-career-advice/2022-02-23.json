With that, you can show them how much you’re underpaid. IMHO if they’re not willing to give you a raise immediately, they should have a clear timeline for when you’ll get a raise and title promotion (i.e., next performance review period).",

If you can, figure out what that role really is…at a minimum, I think that sounds like it’s now a Content Marketing Manager or Content Lead role. With that, you can show them how much you’re underpaid. IMHO if they’re not willing to give you a raise immediately, they should have a clear timeline for when you’ll get a raise and title promotion (i.e., next performance review period)."
